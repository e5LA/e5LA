# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @e5LA 

Software Engineer with interests in engineering, web development, security, and building real-world products.  
Mostly coding in Java, Kotlin, and Python â€” occasionally in PHP.

I recently started contributing to open source and have been enjoying working on [OpenRewrite](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite). 
I'm also exploring other meaningful projects to contribute to and learn from.

Currently working on a few personal projects, like [realworld-java-solutions](https://github.com/e5LA/realworld-java-solutions) - more details coming soon.
