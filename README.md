# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @e5LA (esla) aka *SP*

Software Engineer, interested in engineering, web development, security, and building real products.  
Coding mainly in Java and Python. Sometimes in PHP.

New to open source â€” but not to coding. Currently exploring meaningful projects to learn, contribute, and grow.

Meanwhile, working on private projects.
